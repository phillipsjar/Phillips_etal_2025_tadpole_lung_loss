R environment for paper in submission by Phillips et al. entitled "Lungless tadpoles breathe fresh air into hypotheses for tetrapod lung loss and trait regain"

This code includes everything necessary to recreate analyses and results of the published paper, but we also hope other researchers interested in discrete character evolution will find the embedded functions and scripts useful, especially when using the program BayesTraits by Mark Pagel and Andrew Meade. There is code to format datasets and trees correctly for BayesTraits, analyze BayesTraits outputs, and create stochastic character maps based on posterior distributions from BayesTraits. 

Please reach out to Jack Phillips (jack.phillips12314@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.
